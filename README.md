# NameIT - Simple Renamer
Version - 1.0
The program aims to rename files of series / films, for the final purpose to be recognized by Plex.

Java / JavaFX was used for development.

The idea of developing the program was for personal necessity, after trying to use other free alternatives, none suited my needs.

As a programming student, this is the biggest project I have ever developed alone, learning several concepts for its use in the program. If you have any feedback please share it in the correct sections.
